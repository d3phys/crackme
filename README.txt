                     Hackit
------------------------------------------------
 
Hackit means "Hack it" :)
A group of people create ELF binaries
and their friends have to "hack" it.

a) Without any binary modification:

   Participants can use IDA, radare2 etc. 
   There are at least two exploits 'available'.

b) With ELF modification:

   Each participant creates a utility
   which automatically hacks its friend's binary.
